       <p id="testP" class="funParagrah">Once upon a time, not long ago I was born in August of 1986 in St. Louis, MO. I grew up in Jennings, MO and I graduated top 5 percent of my class from Jennings Senior High. I went to college at the University of Missouri - Columbia known as Mizzou! I graduated with a bachelor's degree in psychology. After completing college, I had a very hard time finding a job using my degree. I found out the hard way when you have a bachelor's in psychology most employers want you to have experience in psychology. Still till this day I have not worked one single job using my degree, but I have had many jobs in my professional career. </p>
      
      
      <h2>Professional Career</h2>
      <p>Within my professional career, I have had many jobs. I have worked at places like:</p>

      <li>Retail Stores</li>

   </ul>    
  
   <h2>Things I like to do for fun:</h2>
   <ul>
      <li>Spending time with my kids</li>
      <li>Spending time with friends</li>
      <li>Going out for drinks/eat</li>

      <li>Going on road trips</li>
      <li>Taking trips</li>
   </ul>

   <h2>Favorite Trip</h2>
   <p>In July of 2022, I took a family trip to Cozumel, Mexico with 23 of my family members, we drove to Mobile, Alamba port to get on a cruise ship to Mexico. We were on the ship for 5 days, the 1st stop was Costa Maya, Mexico and the next stop was Cozumel, Mexico, we had so much fun learning a new culture and trying new foods we had never heard of before. I took my children with us and the experience of learning & trying new things with them was priceless. When I was younger, we were not able to afford to go on trips out of the country so to be able to afford that experience is nothing I never thought I would ever do. We are also planning on going to the Bahamas in 2024, after I complete the Web Development class. We will go in celebration of completion of this course.</p>

   <p>Designing Web pages and computer programming has always been a dream of mine but coming from where I came from, I did not think it was achievable. As a computer programmer(coder) I would like to develop free educational websites for underprivileged children who cannot afford tutors and are struggling in school. I would also like to design websites for influencers, reality stars and entrepreneurs with upcoming businesses. My short-term goal is to work in IT at my current job, Express Scripts.</p>
